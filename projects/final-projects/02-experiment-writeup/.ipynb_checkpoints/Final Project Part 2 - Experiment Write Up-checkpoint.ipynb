    "#### What's the project about? What problem are you solving?\n",
    "This project is about predicting the value (price) of a home based on the home's characteristics.  The housing market plays a vital role in the health of our economy.  People and companies are investing in property all the time for financial gains, but the challenge is the ability to forecast the return on an investment by accurately predicting the final price of a home. \n",
    "* Problem Statement:  Can we predict the price at which a home will sell for on the market given its characteristics?\n",
    "* Hypothesis: Housing units with more than one bedroom and a pool are worth more and will sell at a much higher price than single bedroom homes without a pool."

    "####  Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?\n",
    "In regards to machine learning, this is a supervised learning problem.  The goal here is to build a regression model from a given set of predictors or independent variables, given that response variable or dependent variable (the outcome) is continuous in nature.  We will be predicting the market value (price) of a housing unit for one particular region of the United States.  The price of the home is our output and the characteristics of the home are our predictors.  With this regression analysis I will generate an equation to describe the statistical relationship between one or more predictor variables and the response variable."

    "#### What kind of impact do you think it could have?\n",
    "As I mentioned before, the housing market has a large impact on the economy; it directly affects home builders, the mortgage market, real estates, investment banks, home supply retail outlets, etc. The housing bubble that started in early 2006 affected a majority of states in America. Overvaluation of houses resulted in increased forclosures and a credit crisis, leading to high and prolonged unemployment rates.  I think that proper valuation of housing market can help avoid the onset of a housing bubble.  Lending companies, banks, and individual home owners can all benefit from proper valuation of homes.  In particular, I see value for individuals looking to invest in homes and sell for a profit by having the ability to accurately predict the price of a home before it is sold."

    "In this project I am analyzing a particular geographical region of Iowa.  It is important to note that I am not looking at data from all states, just a region within Iowa.  It is also important to consider the demographics of the population in Ames, which is likely to be very different than the population of a more urban city.  Given these factors, I think that variables relating to the size of a home will have the most impact on predicting the value of the property, more so than the variables relating to the type of home."

Sometimes that data is readily available for public use and other times it is not.  The dataset I have for the city of Ames is for residential home sales between 2006 and 2010.  The type of information contained in the data is similar to what a typical home buyer would want to know before making a purchase.
